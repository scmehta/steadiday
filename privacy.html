        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          SteadiDay supports adults ages 50 to 70 with daily tasks, medications, and connection tools.
          Privacy matters. This policy explains collected information, usage, and user rights.
        </p>

        <h2>What Information Is Collected</h2>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>
          Name, email address, and login details provided during account creation.
        </p>

        <h3>Health Data</h3>
        <p>
          Medication schedules, task lists, and health notes entered by the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Apple Health Data Optional</h3>
        <p>
          With user permission, the app reads selected Apple Health data. Data types include blood type,
          height, weight, steps, heart rate, sleep hours, exercise minutes, and blood pressure. Access
          occurs only after Apple Health integration is enabled and permissions are granted. Allergies,
          medical conditions, emergency contacts, and organ donor status stay inaccessible due to Apple
          restrictions.
        </p>

        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>
          Emergency contacts and favorite contacts added by the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        <p>
          Location used for weather updates and location-based reminders. Access requires permission.
        </p>

        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>
          Device type, operating system, and app version used for technical support and stability.
        </p>

        <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Medication reminders and task notifications</li>
          <li>Data sync across user devices</li>
          <li>Emergency alerts sent to designated contacts</li>
          <li>App improvement and issue resolution</li>
          <li>Local weather updates</li>
          <li>Display of Apple Health wellness metrics when enabled</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Data stays stored on the device and within encrypted cloud storage. Security measures include
          encryption, secure authentication, and routine security reviews. Health information is never
          sold. Apple Health data flows through the Apple HealthKit framework and stays protected by iOS
          security and device authentication.
        </p>

        <h2>Connected Apps and Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          Third-party connections such as Apple Health or Google Calendar access only required data.
          All connections start turned off. User action enables each connection. Disconnection stays
          available through Settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Apple Health Integration</h2>
        <p>
          Apple Health integration requests permission through system prompts. Approved data includes
          blood type, height, weight, steps, heart rate, sleep hours, exercise minutes, and blood pressure.
          Permission removal stays available through iPhone Settings, Privacy, Health, then SteadiDay.
          Apple Health data stays local unless cloud sync is enabled. No third-party sharing occurs.
        </p>

        <h2>Important Notice</h2>
        <p>
          SteadiDay does not function as a medical device. The app does not diagnose, treat, cure, or
          prevent disease. Health data serves informational and wellness tracking purposes only. Medical
          decisions require guidance from a licensed healthcare professional.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Rights</h2>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Users request a copy of stored data.</p>

        <h3>Correction</h3>
        <p>Users update personal information within the app.</p>

        <h3>Deletion</h3>
        <p>Users request account and data removal.</p>

        <h3>Portability</h3>
        <p>Users export data in a standard format.</p>

        <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>Users disable notifications, location access, or analytics at any time.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Advertising cookies and tracking technologies stay unused. Anonymous usage data supports app
          improvement. Opt-out remains available in Settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Subscription and Payment Information</h2>
        <p>
          Premium subscriptions process through the Apple App Store. Payment details remain with Apple.
          SteadiDay receives subscription status only.
        </p>

        <h2>Children and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The app targets adults ages 50 to 70. Information from individuals under age 18 is not knowingly
          collected.
        </p>

        <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Policy updates occur as needed. Significant updates trigger in-app or email notices. Continued
          app use signals acceptance of updated terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          Questions about privacy or data receive support through the Feedback feature in Settings.
